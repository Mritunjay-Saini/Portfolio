        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Hello! I’m <span className="font-semibold text-black">Mritunjay Saini</span>, a passionate and driven software developer with a strong foundation in frontend and backend technologies.
          Currently pursuing my MCA, I’ve already completed my BCA and have developed several responsive, user-friendly web applications using modern tech like React, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          My journey into tech started with a fascination for how things work on the web. Since then, I’ve been sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I'm constantly learning, building, and improving.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I’m especially interested in creating intuitive user interfaces, scalable systems, and writing clean, maintainable code. Whether it's collaborating in a team or working independently, I always strive to deliver value through my work.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new tech trends, helping others learn, or working on side projects that challenge and inspire me.
        </p>
